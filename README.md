# Stream-Video-to-Web-Browser-Using-OpenCV
Real time streaming using Raspberry Pi on a Web Browser

The Project is done by constant Reference of the Article written by Adrian Rosebrock
in his Blog Pyimagesearch.

Along with executing this:
I have done some efforts to run the python script every time RPi boots up.
I have followed the approach given in the article:

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/05/16/running-a-python-opencv-script-on-reboot/

But somehow it didn't work for me.
I will upload the documentation of this which will include each and every step to follow in order
to execute this task.


## Virtual Environment:

I have uploaded a text file in the repository which include everything about the virtual environment
that is How to set it up, installation, Activation, Installing the dependencies and so on.

## Running Python Script on Booting in Raspberry Pi.

Another txt file is uploaded for making this project start as soon as the RPi is boot up.
